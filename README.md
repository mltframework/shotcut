## How to build

**Warning**: building shotcut should only be reserved to beta testers or contributors who know what they are doing.

### Qt Creator

The fastest way to build and try Shotcut dev version is probably using [Qt Creator](http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator).

### From command line

First, check dependencies are satisfied and various paths correctly set to find different libraries and include files (Qt 5, MLT, Frei0r and so forth).

Build `Makefile`:

```
qmake PREFIX=/usr/local/
```
Compile `shotcut`:

```
make
```

`make install` is partially working.

Best way to tesst `shotcut` is to execute it from source folder:

```
./src/shotcut
```
