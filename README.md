## How to build this program

**Warning**: building shotcut should only be reserved to beta testers or contributors who know what they are doing.

### Qt Creator

The fastest way to build and try Shotcut development version is probably using [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download#qt-creator).

To make this easier, we provide [SDKs](https://shotcut.org/notes/) on the website with each release that includes
Shotcut and all of its dependencies. These SDK pages also include setup instructions and tips on how to compile
MLT and other dependencies after updating.

### From command line

First, check dependencies are satisfied and various paths correctly set to find different libraries and include files (Qt 5, MLT, Frei0r and so forth).

Build `Makefile`:

```
qmake PREFIX=/usr/local/
```
Compile `shotcut`:

```
make
```

`make install` is partially working.

Best way to test `shotcut` is to execute it from source folder:

```
./src/shotcut
```
